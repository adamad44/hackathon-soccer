# 🔐 Security Setup Instructions

## Why This Matters

Storing passwords in code is a security risk! Anyone who sees your code can access your database.

## What We Did

### 1. Created Environment Variables

- **`.env`** - Your actual credentials (kept private)
- **`.env.example`** - Template for others to copy

### 2. Updated Code

- Loads credentials from environment variables
- No more hardcoded passwords!
- Error handling if password is missing

### 3. Protected with .gitignore

- `.env` file won't be committed to git
- Your password stays secret

## Files Created/Updated

```
.env              <- Your actual password (private)
.env.example      <- Template for others
.gitignore        <- Updated to protect .env
main.py           <- Now uses environment variables
DATABASE_INFO.md  <- Updated documentation
```

## How It Works

```python
# Old way (insecure):
DB_CONFIG = {
    "password": "147396hg"  # ❌ Visible in code!
}

# New way (secure):
DB_CONFIG = {
    "password": os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD")  # ✅ From .env file
}
```

## For Other Developers

If someone else wants to use your code:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in their own database credentials
3. The code works without exposing passwords

## ✅ Your Database is Now Secure!

- Password is in `.env` (private)
- Code is clean and shareable
- No security risks in version control
